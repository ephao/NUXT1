The integration of technology in livestock farming has transformed traditional practices into more efficient and sustainable operations. From GPS tracking collars to automated feeding systems, these innovations help farmers monitor their herds' health, optimize feed consumption, and enhance overall farm productivity.

Smart sensors and IoT devices now enable real-time monitoring of animal behavior, health metrics, and environmental conditions. This data-driven approach allows farmers to detect potential issues early, reducing veterinary costs and improving animal welfare. Additionally, automated systems help streamline daily tasks, giving farmers more time to focus on strategic decisions and herd management.
